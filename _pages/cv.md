* 2017 - Actual: Systems Analyst
  * Federal University of Sergipe (UFS)
  * Duties included: Maintain and develop academic systems used in institution. 

Research Projects
======
* 2016 - 2017 IHCasa - Modelo de Interação Humano-Casa Baseado em Inteligência Artificial e Processamento de Imagens para a Detecção, Identificação e Interação com Funções Residenciais Simples
  * Description: In according with initial works of scientific initiation developed by our research group, we have investigated the development of a computational model where the main objective was detect the interaction between user and computer from informations provided by a video camera. Thereby, based in Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing, we propose the detection, action recognizing and user interaction with the computer without the need of especial sensors. In this project, the aim is provide a model in which we consider a variation of the IHC (Interaction Human-Computer), denominated by Interaction Human-Home (IHCasa), where we propose a initial model of intelligence, with low cost and efficient, capable of allow interaction with simple residential functions. Therefore, this project has as main objective the propose of a interaction model that, using Artificial Intelligence techniques and Image Processing turn possible the detection, function recognizing and user interaction with a residential environment from representative images located upon a wall, considering informations provided by a video camera, without the use of any especial sensors.. 

* 2015 - 2016 Interação Natural Dinâmica com Imagens Projetadas Baseada em Inteligência Artificial e Atenção Visual
  * Description: Considering as a previous research of this project, our research group was developed an initial application, however a static application, for a set of four possibilities of interaction, pre-definited intrinsically, and in specific locations of a projected image. Therefore, this project aims propose a interaction model where, using artificial intelligence techniques and image processing, turn possible the detection, recognizing of action and interaction with the user of a computer from the number of actions and its locations defined by the user its own, in the way that each action would be related with any computational navigation action possible in its manual form, considering informations provided by a video camera, in witch do not be necessary the use of especial sensors. For validate the proposed mechanism, was develop a application for the intuitive interaction between the user and the projected image by a image projector (datashow)..  

* 2014 - 2015 Algoritmos Avançados de Inteligência Artificial Aplicados ao Mapeamento de Ambiente e Controle de Trajetória de Robô - FASE 2
  * Description: This project has as main objective presents a method of autonomous navigation for mobile robots using a hybrid architecture, composed by probabilistic mapping techniques and navigation control based on classical search methods, as follows: blind search, heuristic search and search by reinforcement learning. In resume, a robot should learning the limits of its environment and how to move around in a intelligent manner between two distinct points. For the simulation of the environment, have been used simulation ambients, turning possible analyze the behavior of the mobile robot through the environment.
