Hello! My name is Iury Batista. I am attending Masters Degree in Computer Science and Computational Math at Institute of Computer Science and Computational Math at University of SÃ£o Paulo (ICMC-USP). I am envolved in research projects in Artificial Intelligence, most precisely in the subjects of Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics. Additionally, I have bachelor degree in Information Systems by the Federal Universiry of Sergipe (UFS), where i have been envolved in AI research (as by now) and also in Human-Computer Interaction. As my bachelor degree final work  I developed a mobile application where, using CNNs and LSTM, capture, analise and describe in real time and in natural language, the envirounment to visual impaired persons.    

Before attending in Masters, i have worked as System Analyst in the Information Technology Center of Federal University of Sergipe, were I maintained the academic systems.

I have strong interest in the study of deep learning, with a special focuse on Reinforcement Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and Long-Sort Term Memory network. Regardless of, Visual Attention is also in my studies themes.
