Hello! My name is Iury Batista. I am graduated in Information Systems by the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS). I have been envolved in research projects along these years in the field of Artificial Intelligence, most precisely in the subjects of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics and Human-Computer Interaction. 

I currently work as System Analysis in the Information Technology Center of Federal University of Sergipe, were I develop and maintain the academic systems.

Today, I have a strong interest in the study of deep learning, with a special focuse on Convolutional Neural Networks and Long-Sort Term Memory network, aiming the understanding of images and natural language setences correlated to them. Regardless of, Visual Attention is also in my studies themes. 

As university course final work, I developed a mobile application where, using CNNs and LSTM, capture, analise and describe, in real time and in natural language, the envirounment to visual impaired persons.
