Hello! My name is Iury Batista. I have master's degree in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at Instituto de Ciências Matematicas e de Computação, Universidade de São Paulo (ICMC-USP). I was envolved in research projects in Artificial Intelligence, most precisely in the subjects of Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Robotics. Additionally, I have bachelor's degree in Information Systems by the Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS), where i have been envolved in AI research (as by now) and also in Human-Computer Interaction. As my bachelor's degree final work, I developed a mobile application where, using ConvNets and LSTM, capture, analise and describe, in real time and in natural language, the envirounment to visual impaired persons.    

Before attending in masters, i have worked as Systems Analyst in the Information Technology Center of Universidade Federal de Sergipe, were I maintained the academic systems.

I have strong interest in the study of deep learning, with a special focuse on Deep Reinforcement Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and Long-Sort Term Memory network. Regardless of, Visual Attention is also in my studies themes.
