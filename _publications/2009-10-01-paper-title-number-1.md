title: "Dynamic Natural Interaction with Projected Images"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-eniac-interaction
excerpt: 'In the last years computers have been turned in common day-by-day devices. Trying to facilitate and approximate the interaction between man and the machine, new forms to interact has been researched and developed, as the use of gestures. This work has as objective the development of a alternative model to real sensors, taking advantage of techniques for scenes interpretation and computational vision, through capture of images, pre-processing, visual attention, segmentation and classification. The model was tested in several environments and, according to the accuracy values obtained from a confusion matrix, has been possible conclude for its applicability and efficiency.'
