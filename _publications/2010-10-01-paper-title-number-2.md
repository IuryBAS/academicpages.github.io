excerpt: 'The scenarios as smart homes and its devices requires novel ways to perform  interactive actions. In this work we explore and develop a model to interact, in a natural,  easy learning and intuitive manner, with a smart home, without use special sensors or  another controllers, based on interpretation of complex context images captured with a trivial  camera. We use artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques to recognize action  icons in a uncontrolled environment and identify user interact actions gestures.'

Abstract The scenarios as smart homes and its devices requires novel ways to perform  interactive actions. In this work we explore and develop a model to interact, in a natural,  easy learning and intuitive manner, with a smart home, without use special sensors or  another controllers, based on interpretation of complex context images captured with a trivial  camera. We use artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques to recognize action  icons in a uncontrolled environment and identify user interact actions gestures. Our model  connects with well know computational platforms, which communicate with devices and  another residential functions. Preliminary tests demonstrated that our model fits well for the  objectives, working in different conditions of light, distance and ambiances.
